## What Are Webhooks?

Webhooks let you automatically send HTTP requests to another API when specific events happen in your scraper â€” such as when a scrape starts, completes, or fails.

## Setting Up a Webhook

Follow these steps to create and connect a webhook in MrScraper:

1. Open your **MrScraper dashboard**.
2. Click the **gear icon** on the left panel and select **Webhooks**.
3. On the **Webhooks page**, click the + icon in the top-right corner.
4. Fill in the webhook details:

    - **Request Type**: Choose `POST` or `PUT`
    - **Event**: Select when the webhook should trigger (e.g., *Scraping Started*, *Scraping Completed*, *Scraping Failed*)
    - **Name**: Give your webhook a descriptive name
    - **URL**: Enter the endpoint of your external webhook app
    - **Headers**: (Optional) Add any custom headers

5. Click **Submit** to save your webhook.
6. Go to your **Scraper Settings** page.
7. Under **Webhook Settings**, select the webhook you just created and click **Save Webhook Settings**.
