    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Select any element">
 Try to hover over any elements. You'll see a dashed purple border when hovering on any elements. To select that element, press **Right Click**. Any selected elements will have a solid green border.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Extension elements and controls">

    </Frame>

 The extension consists of various controls, such as:

    - The input field in the middle for manual input or input results.
    - The trash/ clear button. When clicked, this button will reset the CSS selector and root element.
    - The dashed window button is used to select the root node. 
    - The multi/single square button. The button switches the selector mode between single and multiple select modes. By default, it uses multiple select modes. 
    - The copy button is used to copy the input result.
  </Step>
   <Step title="Single and multiple select modes">
 You can choose between single and multiple select modes when selecting elements. 
    
    - Multiple select modes will generalize a CSS selector that works on various elements. The multiple-select mode will be useful if you want to select all title elements. 

    <Frame caption="Multiple select mode selection result example">
        <img src="/images/extension/selected.png" />
    </Frame>
    
    - Single select mode is useful when you want to target only one element, as it tries to find a unique selector for that element.

    <Frame caption="Single select mode selection result example">
        <img src="/images/extension/single-result.png" />
    </Frame>

 Based on the above examples, a single select mode will try to find a unique selector by utilizing the element ID and element position. Meanwhile, multiple select modes will try to avoid it to ensure the selector is general.
  </Step>
   <Step title="Changing root node">
 You can limit the element by changing the root node when selecting elements. Changing the root node can be useful when if you try to target multiple elements, but there are some other elements that you don't wish to select. 

    <Frame caption="Element selection with root node">
        <img src="/images/extension/root.png" />
    </Frame>
    
 Click on the dashed window button to select the root node. Any element selected during this mode will be marked as a root element that has a solid blue border. Click on the button again to cancel (before selecting any root element) or clear the button to reset the root element.     
  </Step>
  <Step title="The input field">
 The input field will be filled with the generated selector when selecting an element. You can also type any CSS Selector to test if it works as intended by comparing it with the green-bordered elements.

    <Frame caption="Copy or edit the selector on input field">

    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once you have followed through the steps, you're ready to utilize the extension to help with your scraping process.
