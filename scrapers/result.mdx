When you run a scraper, the results are typically returned in a structured format such as JSON. The exact structure of the results will depend on the specific scraper you are using and the data it is designed to collect.

## Accessing Scraper Results

To access the results from a scraper, you can follow these steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open result page">
        Navigate to **Result page** by clicking the **playlist icon** on the left sidebar.

        <Frame>
            ![](/images/scrapers/result/step-1.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Click on a scraper to view the results">
        <Frame>
            ![](/images/scrapers/result/step-2.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="View the results">
        <Frame>
            ![](/images/scrapers/result/step-3.png)
        </Frame>

        In this page, there are four tabs you can choose from, **Extractions**, **Screenshots**, **Recording**, and **HTML**.

        - **Extractions**: This tab displays the structured data extracted by the scraper in JSON format.
        - **Screenshots**: This tab shows the screenshots of the pages that were scraped.
        - **Recording**: This tab contains the video recording of the entire scraping session.

            <Note>
                The **Recording** tab will only be available if you use manual scraper mode.
            </Note>

        - **HTML**: This tab provides the raw HTML content of the pages that were scraped.
