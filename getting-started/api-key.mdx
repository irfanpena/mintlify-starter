An API key allows your applications to securely access the MrScraper API. It acts as a unique identifier for authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can make requests.

Follow the steps below to generate one:

1. Open your **MrScraper dashboard**.
2. On the homepage, click **Generate API Key**.
3. Click **New Token**.
4. Enter a **name** and set an **expiration date** for your API key.
5. Click **Create**.
6. Copy your new API key and store it in a secure location.

<Warning>
    **Remember that your API key is a secret!**

    Never expose it in client-side code, such as browsers or apps. Always load your API key securely from environment variables or a server-side configuration.
</Warning>
